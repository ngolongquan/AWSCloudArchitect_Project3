Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
- IAM role allows full access S3 bucket
- S3 buckets does not enable encryption.
- Security Group allows all traffics (inbound/outbound) from any IP
- Application Load Balancer is not configued HTTPS redirection
Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Limit resources and coressponding actions for IAM role on S3 buckets
- Enable encrytion for S3 bucket which contains sensitive data (Eg: S3 secret) 
- Limit the traffic (inbound/outbound) for Security Group (for cidr: update IP range ;for port: just allow 80/443 for public internet access) 
- Application Load Balancer needs to configued HTTPS redirection
